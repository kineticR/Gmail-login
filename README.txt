This is my first front end Jquery UI/UX element.
It's a replication of the lovely Gmail login with a scroll down effect.
Feel free to use my code and message me on suggestions how I could improve it.
I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out.
Tested on chrome but will work on all other major browsers.

:]
