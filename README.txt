See it in action here - http://rhysxy.com/projects/gmail-login/

This is my first front end JQuery UI/UX element.
It's a replication of the lovely Gmail login with a scroll down effect.
Feel free to use my code and message me with suggestions how I could improve it.
Tested in chrome, it will work in all other browsers too.
